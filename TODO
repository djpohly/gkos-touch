Implement elisions (keycode + list of elided keycodes)
- How to define them?
- How do they interact with mods?
- How do we elide e.g. " " with "Shift-1"?
Don't reset shift on initial macro space (new TYPE_*?)
Make speed tester that takes characters to alternate
Make long ver. for all key combos L+R
