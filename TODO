Allow mods to behave independently in macros
- e.g. macro $ = Shift + 4
- Shift + $ = (no extra Shift) 4 (releases Shift)
- ShiftLock + $ = (no extra Shift) 4 (still ShiftLock)
- New TYPE_FORCEMOD?
Implement elisions (keycode + list of elided keycodes)
Don't reset shift on initial macro space (new TYPE_*?)
Make speed tester that takes characters to alternate
Make long ver. for all key combos L+R
